# Sprint 6: Advanced Accessibility & Automation

**Goal:** Implement the "Smart" features that make Readera a power tool, focusing on TTS and PDF Reflow.

## Features
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Integration with system speech synthesis (Web Speech API or Tauri native). Support for background playback and highlighting while reading.
- **PDF Reflow**: Use `pdf.js` to extract text and reflow it into a responsive HTML view (converting fixed-layout PDFs into "EPUB-like" experiences).
- **Auto-Scroll**: Hands-free reading with adjustable speed.
- **Margin Cropping**: Automatic or manual cropping for PDFs to remove whitespace on small screens.
